	<h2>Module 1 & Stress</h2>
	<p id="intro">Hi, my name is Justin Howell and I live in Orlando, Florida. I work at Disney World as a full-time coordinator at one of the busiest quick-service restaurants in the world! I used to live in Roanoke, Virginia.</p>
	<p>My entire life I was infatuated with Physics, however, I only have time to self-teach. I never had too much money and moved out at 16/17, so figuring out my college life was never the easiest. I joined the Army for three years and then began working at Disney World due to my lack of money for college.</p>
	<p> I recently adopted a cat; it has been my favorite and least favorite thing ever. <span id="sentence">His name is Fraction</span> and he is a black-short-haired cat. He also has five toes on each paw!</p>
	<p>I recently got a new apartment with my girlfriend, Emily. We are both excited as this is our first apartment and our first time really living together. Overall, I am truly excited to learn in this class!</p>
